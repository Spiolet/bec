### Hole #1 
A par 5 to start off your round, with water running through the fairway right after the tee boxes. After that, it’s pretty straight with a tree in the middle.

### Hole #2
It's a par 3, nothing special, just that you have to cross the water with your shot.

### Hole #3
A par 4, with a slight curve to the left and a narrow fairway and trees on both sides.

### Hole #4
A par 4, crossing a lake right after the tee box, big uphill with a somewhat wide fairway with trees and mud behind the green.

### Hole #5
A straight par 4 with a bunker on the right.

### Hole #6
Mostly a straight hole with bunkers left and right. 2 bunkers on the left and behind the green, it is advised to go right and short.

### Hole #7
Around 260 yards to the water and around 170 from the start of the water to the green

### Hole #8
A par 3 with an island green with around 170 from the tee box to the green.

### Hole #9
A very straight par four with about 330 yards from the tee box to the green.

### Hole #10
A very challenging par 5 that is 500 yards with a curve at around 300.

### Hole #11
A 400 yard par 4 with a slight curve to the left, with no obstacles but the fairway is narrow.

### Hole #12
A straight 200 yard par 3, bunkers on the right, also bushes and poison ivy.

### Hole #13
A 350 par 4 with a giant lake right after the tee box. 2 sections of fairway, 3 bunkers connecting the two.

### Hole #14
A slight right par 5 with water, after the water, the hole turns to the right and the total distance is 475.

### Hole #15
A 150 par 3, again an island green, only safe on the right, short, left, or long is lost.

### Hole #16
A 300 yard par 4, with water right in front of the green, a bunker around the green, basically another island green surrounded by a bunker.

### Hole #17
The hardest hole on the course, also named “Devil’s Delight”, a 500 yard par 5, with a mandatory layup, first turning to the right and then turning to the left.

### Hole #18
380 par 4 with a narrow fairway and it curves to the right, if the ball misses the fairway right, then it will most likely get in the water hazard.
