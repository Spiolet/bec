# Fall River Country Club
## Fall River, MA

### Hole 1: Par 5
A steady hole to start the round. Aim to miss a little right off the tee as the left is trouble. Fairly common approach shot with a back-to-front green.

### Hole 2:  par 5
Pretty open tee shot to grip and rip it down the slope for a shorter 2nd shot. If laying up, make sure not to go through the fairway. The third shot is a pretty big uphill, with bunkers long and 
around the green. 

### Hole 3: par 3
Hazard left with a severe back-to-front green. Aim to be short of the flag as downhill putts usually end up off the green. Play smart golf.

### Hole 4: par 4
Drivable hole because of a dogleg left. Keep in mind that there are large trees that may block your approach shot if you hit it through the fairway out right. Two-tier-ish green.

### Hole 5:  par 4
Tight tee shot and elevated green. Aim to miss a little right or layup possibly with a wood or iron. Green slopes from right to left.

### Hole 6: par 3
Blindish tee shot with a long green. Bunkers on both sides and a sloping green. Long or short isn’t bad. 

### Hole 7: par 4
Tight hole with ob left and woods right. Hit the fairway finder shot and on the approach shot, do not go long of the pin as it’s a two-tiered green. 

### Hole 8: par 4
Severe left-to-right fairway,  but OB left. Aim to be a little left off the tee and let the slope work it 
back down. Fairly flat green.

### Hole 9: par 4
Long but fairly open par 4. Aim for distance off the tee and the middle of the green on the approach shot. Remember that a par is a good score here.

### Hole 10: par 5
The ocean hazard left off the tee so aim to bail out a little right. Be aware of bunkers about 40 yards in front of the green. Fairly raised flat green. 

### Hole 11: par 4
Aim to hit about 190-200 yards off the tee as the fairway runs out. Make sure you are not blocked out by the trees on the left. You can go a little right on the 2nd shot and use the bank to bounce it back onto the green or fringe. Do not miss left or long as you will go out of play into the hazard. 

### Hole 12: par 3
Severe slope left of the green that you can use to assist your tee shot. Don’t come up short as there is a gully that might make your second shot difficult. Pretty simple and shorter length par 3

### Hole 13: par 5
Blind tee shot. Aim to be a little right as there are woods left. Note that there is fescue on the right as well and if your tee shot doesn’t get far enough down the slope, you might have a difficult stance on your second shot.

### Hole 14: par 4
Blind tee shot. Slight uphill and dogleg left. Aim for your tee shot to be a little right to use the slope. The green is like a massive bowl but usually the backstop isn’t too effective. You can land short and run it up as it’s a front to back green.

### Hole 15: par 3
Downhill par 3 with bunkers on both sides and sloppy green. Pay attention to the pin location and make sure you play enough break. The miss is to be just short to leave a fairly straight foward chip.

### Hole 16: par 4
Short uphill par 4 that demands a good tee shot. Could be an iron or wood to lay up as the fairway runs out. Be mindful that going left on the tee shot could result in you being blocked out by trees on the approach. Blind approach shot uphill usually. Bail out right if you need to. 

### Hole 17: 
Severe Dogleg right. Do not be too greedy and try to hit it long off the tee as if you risk going through and into the woods. Make sure you have enough club to carry the hazard though. Play a slight cut if possible. Approach shot is blind as well so make sure you add enough yardage with the uphill.

### Hole 18: 
Slight dogleg left. Trees left and the 10th hole on the right. Important tee shot to finish off the round strong. Tricky green with severe slope. Bunkers on either side of the green.
