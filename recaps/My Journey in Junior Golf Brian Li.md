My Journey in Junior Golf

I first picked up a golf club when I was nine years old and instantly fell in love with the game. My dad bought me a small set of U.S. Kids Golf clubs that happened to be on sale, and we would often head to McGolf Driving Range to practice and take swing lessons every week. Two years later, my dad signed me up for my very first tournament — a local U.S. Kids Golf event at Gardner Municipal Golf Course. I shot a 91, which honestly exceeded my expectations and made me even more passionate about the sport. In the following two years, I played in more U.S. Kids tournaments, racking up a couple of first-place finishes and medals that motivated me to keep improving. 

When I entered seventh grade, I began competing in U.S. Challenge Cup tournaments. These events had stronger and more experienced players, many coming from Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine. For me, this was a big change — my weekly wins turned into staring at the bottom of the leaderboard. That reality pushed me to train harder and smarter, focusing on areas of my game that I had once ignored or found boring. Slowly, I began to see progress. During the summer before ninth grade, I shot my first sub-70 round — a 3-under 67 — a moment I’ll never forget.

 In my freshman year of high school, I met seniors on my golf team who were heading off to play at the collegiate level. They suggested that I should bring my game to the national level and compete outside my comfort zone. Inspired by their advice, I trained through the fall and winter, working on strength and distance. The following summer, I played in my first AJGA qualifier in Vermont. There were over 50 players from all over the country, but only six spots were available. Incredibly, I shot an amazing round of 73 to put me through as the 6th qualifier into the actual tournament. In the main tournament, I played against 84 nationally ranked competitors — some already committed to top Division I colleges. After two intense days, I narrowly missed the cut for the final round by a single stroke, shooting 80 and 72. 

That miracle week at the AJGA tournament gave me all the confidence I needed to accomplish something I never thought was possible. That summer, I played in three more AJGA qualifiers, qualifying for two and barely missing the remaining one by a single stroke. In addition, I had a couple of good finishes at some regional tournaments, allowing me to earn enough PBE stars to play in AJGA tournaments without needing to qualify in the 2025 season. 

At the end of my sophomore spring, at the HJGT Massachusetts Spring Open in Chicopee, I picked up my first major victory after coming from behind with a 71 in brutal conditions on the second day. That win kick-started my summer, when I competed in an AJGA tournament in Kentucky. I shot 75, 73, and 68 to finish tied for 21st — my best result in a national tournament so far. In the following weeks, I played in more Challenge Cup tournaments, highlighted by a fifth-place finish among 118 players at the U.S. Challenge Cup Boys Championship. 

However, those achievements didn’t come without setbacks. I missed the cut in my remaining four AJGA events by just one or two strokes, leaving early for the airport and replaying the decisions I made on the course in my head. As my sophomore summer came to an end, I reflected on all the highs and lows of my season. I hope that by learning from these experiences and building on my setbacks, I can continue to grow and reach my full potential — both mentally and physically.
