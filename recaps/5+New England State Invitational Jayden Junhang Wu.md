On October 18-19 was my second time playing the New England State Invitational at Tunxis Plantation Golf Course. I did not have a really good first day but I had 2 birdies and 5 bogeys. I had birdies on 5 and 9. On five I hit a perfect driver down the middle of the fairway about 230 yards. Then I hit a 5 wood a little bit past the green. I hit a bump and run down the slope and ended at about 3 feet. I tapped it in for my first birdie of the tournament. I had my second birdie on the ninth hole. It was a short par 4, with a tiny dogleg right. I hit a perfect driver that flew all the way to 50 yards in. I pitched a little spinny lob wedge that spun back a little and went to about 30 feet. Back when I was nine, I probably would have gotten mad because I was young and naive. Now, I do not get mad because I am older and because it was fine since I was even through 8 holes. I kept my patience and walked to my ball and took long enough to figure out the line. I walked around my line to look at the other side, sideways, and back again. Over the summer when I played Worlds, Red White and Blue, and Optimist International Championships, I got better with my mental health and developed a calmer attitude. I keep on working to maintain and to keep that the same.
