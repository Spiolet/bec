          <p>
            Brian Li is a student at the Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, Massachusetts, and serves as the leader of the Boston Eaglets. 
            Born in China, he moved with his family to Waban, Massachusetts, where their home overlooks the 8th hole of the Highland Course at Brae Burn Country Club. 
            Initially unfamiliar with golf, Brian’s introduction to the sport came when a neighbor invited him to take a swing on the green behind his backyard. 
            At the age of nine, he began practicing regularly with his father at McGolf, where he learned the basics and developed a deep love for the game. 
            A year later, he entered his first U.S. Kids tournament with little more than enthusiasm and curiosity. 
            Though he knew little about the sport’s rules at the time, that experience ignited his passion for competitive golf and marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey of growth and connection.
